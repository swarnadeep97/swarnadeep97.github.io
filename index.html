			<span id="aboutmestuff">
				I am a fourth year dual degree student at IIT Kanpur.
				<br>
				I grew up in Haridwar and did my schooling from Delhi Public School, Ranipur. Due to my prior interest in Programming and Mathematics, I decided on Computer Science to be my major, a decision which I will never regret.<br>
				I usually spend my time practicing on some competitive programming website or reading about topics on the same. I also have a keen interest in anything related to science and usually spend my time reading articles of the same on various platforms.<br>
				I usually listen to rock/prog music, although I am pretty open to listen to any genre of music.<br>
				I also like to play Table Tennis, 8 Ball Pool, Basketball and Poker when I am not doing any of the above.
